# ToDos
+ revert rails changes and simplify
+ add bootstrap modals for new event creation
+ sanitize input

+ ability to delete events

+ improve js readability -- model after tictactoe org visually separate js code

+ sat/sun diff color?
+ create repeating events -- use date-range-picker from driftingruby?
+ multi day events auto move to first day of event -- fix so that view goes to day in which event was clicked

+ enhance mobile view -- bootstrap helped, but need to long press to create events
  add + or something to more easily add. maybe change add event so user could also
  click another link to create event in addition to inline event

+ in week view, if user clicks on a time slot, open that slot in day view, then
  build appointment prompt


+ ?blank events?

+ ability to edit in-line
+ easier editing of exact times
+ edit length of multi day events

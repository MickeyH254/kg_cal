# ToDos
+ focus on 30 min length appointments only to streamline

+ sanitize input

+ drag and drop does not update event on right and vise versa

+ ability to delete events

+ create repeating events -- use date-range-picker from driftingruby?
+ multi day events auto move to first day of event -- fix so that view goes to day in which event was clicked

+ in week view, if user clicks on a time slot, open that slot in day view, then
  build appointment prompt or maybe eliminate week view?

+ ?blank events?

+ add + or something to more easily add. maybe change add event so user could also click another link to create event in addition to inline event

+ enhance mobile view -- bootstrap helped, but need to long press to create events

+ hover over event in month view to get more info

## Second priority
+ add title, content, url, start, end time fields


## Rails -- later
+ (x) add back end to persist data
+ (x) rails?? https://github.com/bokmann/fullcalendar-rails
+ use ajax with inline forms
+ easier editing of exact times
+ edit length of multi day events

### DONE!
+ (ok) check on ability to create overlapping appointments
+ (x) revert rails changes and simplify
+ improve js readability -- model after tictactoe org visually separate js code
+ sat/sun diff color?
+ (x) get events to load better -- use seed data generated from rails?
+ pop up view of eventLimit has overlapping view issues with right pane
+ add bootstrap modals for new event creation
+ ability to edit in modal
